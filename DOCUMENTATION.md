   - **Resolution Consistency**: All models produce outputs at original input resolution
   - **Fair Comparison**: Identical resolution enhancement applied across different architectures
   - **Computational Efficiency**: Minimal overhead while maintaining model-specific advantages

### 1.2 Tree Crown Delineation Dataset

The Tree Crown Delineation (TCD) dataset contains satellite imagery with pixel-level annotations for tree crown segmentation:

- **Images**: High-resolution satellite/aerial imagery of forest areas
- **Annotations**: Pixel-level segmentation masks (under 'annotation' field)
- **Classes**: Binary (tree crown vs. background)
- **Structure**: Training, validation, and test splits

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Data Processing

The data processing pipeline includes:

1. **Dataset Loading and Consistent Shuffling**:
   - Centralized `load_and_shuffle_dataset` function
   - Fixed seed for deterministic shuffling
   - Pre-shuffled dataset passed to all pipeline components

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - Resizing to fixed dimensions (default: 512×512)
   - Normalization for standardized pixel values
   - Automatic conversion from grayscale to RGB

3. **Segmentation Mask Processing**:
   - Support for 'annotation' field (TCD-specific)
   - Binary format conversion (0: background, 1: tree_crown)
   - Handling of multi-channel annotations
   - Invalid sample detection and skipping

4. **DataLoader Creation**:
   - Efficient batch processing with PyTorch DataLoaders
   - Automatic creation of validation split if needed
   - Consistent error handling

### 2.2 Model Architecture

The BARE strategy enhances multiple architectures (SegFormer, PSPNet, SETR) with the following key modifications:

1. **Resolution Handling**:
   - Modified the decoder to produce logits at the full input resolution
   - Implemented efficient upsampling strategies to minimize computational overhead
   - Added configuration options to control the output resolution behavior

2. **Loss Calculation**:
   - Adapted loss functions to work with full-resolution logits
   - Implemented weighted loss strategies to address class imbalance in tree crown segmentation
   - Added support for boundary-aware loss components to enhance edge preservation

3. **Model Configuration**:
   - Extended the model configuration system to accommodate BARE-specific parameters
   - Created a unified interface supporting multiple architectures (SegFormer, PSPNet, SETR)
   - Maintained backward compatibility with pretrained models

Implementation is in `model.py` with architecture-specific classes enhanced with the BARE strategy.

### 2.3 Training Pipeline

The training pipeline is centralized and includes:

1. **Unified Flow**:
   - Consistent dataset handling throughout
   - Integrated checkpointing and evaluation
   - Standardized configuration

2. **Training Loop**:
   - Forward and backward passes with gradient accumulation
   - Mixed precision support
   - Periodic evaluation and checkpoint saving
   - TensorBoard integration for metrics

3. **Validation**:
   - Regular model evaluation
   - Worst-case sample visualization
   - Comprehensive metrics reporting

### 2.4 Optimization Techniques

Several optimization techniques improve training and performance:

1. **Mixed Precision Training**:
   - Combined 16-bit and 32-bit precision
   - Device-specific implementation (CPU vs. CUDA)
   - Memory usage reduction and faster training

2. **Gradient Accumulation**:
   - Accumulation over multiple batches
   - Support for effective larger batch sizes
   - Training stability improvements

3. **Learning Rate Scheduling**:
   - Linear scheduling with warmup
   - Cosine decay options
   - Checkpoint-based resumption

4. **Class Weight Handling**:
   - Inverse frequency-based weight computation
   - Integration with loss function
   - Support for different weighting strategies

5. **Gradient Checkpointing**:
   - Enabled via the `"gradient_checkpointing": true` setting in the configuration.
   - Reduces memory usage significantly during training by trading computation for memory. Instead of storing intermediate activations for the entire model to compute gradients, it recomputes them during the backward pass.
   - **Trade-off**: Increases training time due to the recomputation overhead. Ideal for training large models on GPUs with limited memory.
   - Implemented by calling `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()` if available on the Hugging Face model.

6. **DataLoader Performance**:
   - Configurable options in `config.py` to optimize data loading speed:
     - `"dataloader_pin_memory": true`: If using CUDA, pins memory for faster CPU-to-GPU transfers. Can increase CPU memory usage slightly.
     - `"dataloader_persistent_workers": true`: Keeps worker processes alive between epochs, reducing overhead for dataset initialization and startup time, especially for complex datasets or augmentations. Requires `num_workers > 0`.
     - `"dataloader_prefetch_factor": N`: Number of batches loaded in advance by each worker (default: 2). Higher values can improve GPU utilization by reducing I/O wait times but increase memory usage. Requires `num_workers > 0`.
   - These settings are passed to the PyTorch `DataLoader` in `dataset.py`.

### 2.5 Evaluation Metrics

1. **Primary Metrics**:
   - Mean IoU (Intersection over Union)

### 4.3 Research Background

The BARE strategy and associated pipeline were developed as part of research addressing challenges in high-resolution semantic segmentation for remote sensing applications. The key motivations were:

1. **Boundary Preservation Challenge**: Conventional semantic segmentation models often struggle with preserving fine-grained details at object boundaries, particularly in complex natural scenes like forests.

2. **Resolution Trade-offs**: Most segmentation architectures reduce spatial resolution internally to manage computational complexity, which can lead to detail loss at object boundaries.

3. **Domain-Specific Requirements**: Tree crown delineation in remote sensing imagery presents unique challenges including varying tree sizes, dense canopy overlap, and complex textures that require specialized approaches.

Our BARE strategy was designed to address these challenges while maintaining computational efficiency, providing consistent improvements across multiple architectures (SegFormer, PSPNet, SETR) for tasks requiring high boundary accuracy.

## 5. Usage Patterns

### 5.1 CLI Interface

The command-line interface provides a simple entry point:

```bash
python main.py --dataset_name restor/tcd --model_name nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512 --output_dir ./outputs
```

Additional parameters can customize:
- Training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- Model configuration (architecture, weights)
- Optimization settings (mixed precision, gradient accumulation)

### 5.2 Python API

The Python API allows programmatic use:

```python
from config import Config
from pipeline import run_training_pipeline

# Create configuration
config = Config({
    "dataset_name": "restor/tcd",
    "model_name": "nvidia/segformer-b0-finetuned-ade-512-512",
    "output_dir": "./outputs",
    "num_epochs": 10
})

# Run training pipeline
results = run_training_pipeline(config=config)
```

This enables integration with larger ML pipelines or custom workflows.

### 5.3 Jupyter Notebook

The `bare_pipeline.ipynb` notebook provides an interactive interface for:

- Dataset exploration and visualization
- Model training with real-time monitoring
- Result inspection and analysis
